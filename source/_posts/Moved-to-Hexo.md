I moved my blog to Hexo and dumped Jekyll. I'm so glad I made this change;
Hexo is much more feature-packed, easier to use, and the missing features like
post tags and such work. 

I might have broken the RSS functionality, but other than that, the older posts
should still have the exact same URL and should work seemlessly.

Hope the new blog looks better. I used the [Anodyne theme](https://github.com/klugjo/hexo-theme-anodyne)
for my blog and I think it looks amazing. 

It also comes with Disqus support and I'm looking forward to reading the comments!

Thanks for visiting my blog as always.
